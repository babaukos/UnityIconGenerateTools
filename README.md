# Creating item icons for your game

This repository contains two custom Unity Editor tools to help you generate previews of your assets / game:

1. **Camera Preview Generator**  
   Generates a PNG image of a selected prefab or GameObject using a custom camera. It allows you to configure the camera’s field of view, distance, rotation, resolution, background color, and layer-based rendering options.

2. **Icon Preview Generator**  
   Generates a PNG preview (icon) for a selected prefab or GameObject. You can choose to use the asset’s folder path for saving the icon automatically or manually specify a save path.
